#' BioC2019 Pan-Cancer Workshop
#' 
#' @description In this workshop we will show the capability of TCGAbiolinks and Moonlight,
#' to integrate multi -omics data from different consortium and to reproduce the
#' six immune subtypes from TCGA PanCancer and how features (Immune Subtypes,
#' Oncogenic Processes, Driver Genes and Stemness) can be used by the end user to
#' expand their understating of their own un-published data.
