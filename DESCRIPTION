Description: Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA’s) Pan-Cancer Atlas initiative presented a comprehensive 
collection of 27 studies covering 11,000 patient tumors from 33 cancer types. These studies investigated cancer 
complexity from different angles and integrating multi -omics and clinical data . 
The computational tools developed from these studies have led to the identification of  299 cancer-driver 
genes and over 3,400 driver mutations. While these methods have uncovered the cancers complexity, 
it still remains critical to clarify the consequences of each alteration and with the underlying biological effects.
In order to deal with the challenges of data retrieval and integration, TCGAbiolinks (Colaprico et al., 2016) 
 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/TCGAbiolinks.html) and 
DeepBlueR (Albrecht et al., 2017)
 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DeepBlueR.html)  were developed to retrieve data from TCGA, 
 CPTAC, GTEx, GEO and IHEC, Blueprint, ENCODE, Roadmap, respectively.  
 Tumor-specific cancer-driver-gene events and downstream impact can be elucidated with 
 MoonlightR by integrating those datasets (Colaprico et al. 2018)
(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MoonlightR.html). 
Moonlight distills literature findings, pathways, and multiple -omics data sources into a comprehensive assessment 
of a gene’s roles and functions.  MoonlightR has been used to pinpoint context-specific differential gene programs
in varied scenarios.
For example, MoonlightR unveiled novel biological insight from mutation-context differences  between samples with 
and without BRCA1/2 mutations, as well as in known cancer-driver gene mutations (Ding et al., 2018). 
Using transcriptomic and epigenetic data, the stemness score from Moonlight detected cell-of-origin differences 
associated with oncogenic de-differentiation, as well as potential drug targets (Malta et al., 2018).  
The versatility of the TCGAbiolinks and MoonlightR tools has been illustrated across diverse studies, including 
oncogenic processes identification (Ding et al., 2018),  oncogenic clinically actionable  driver genes discovery 
(Bailey et al., 2018),   and comprehensive immune landscape characterization (Thorsson et al., 2018).
