Description: Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGAâ€™s) Pan-Cancer Atlas initiative 
        presented a comprehensive collection of 27 studies covering 11,000 patient tumors 
        from 33 cancer types. These studies investigated cancer complexity from different 
        angles by integrating multi -omics and clinical data. In particular, computational 
        analyses have led to the identification of 299 cancer-driver genes and over 
        3,400 driver mutations. However, it still remains critical to clarify the 
        consequences of each alteration and the underlying biological effects. 
        We will discuss several computational tools that are useful in clarifying gene
        functions when performing integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets. 
        In order to deal with the challenges of data retrieval and integration, 
        TCGAbiolinks (Colaprico et al., 2016) and DeepBlueR (Albrecht et al., 2017) were 
        developed to retrieve data from TCGA, CPTAC, GTEx, GEO and IHEC, Blueprint, ENCODE, 
        Roadmap, respectively. Tumor-specific cancer-driver-gene events and downstream 
        impact can be elucidated with MoonlightR by integrating these datasets 
        (Colaprico et al. 2018) (). TCGAbiolinks and MoolightR have been used 
        successfully in multiple studies for oncogenic processes identification 
        (Ding et al., 2018), oncogenic clinically actionable driver genes discovery 
        (Bailey et al., 2018), and comprehensive immune landscape characterization 
        (Thorsson et al., 2018)
